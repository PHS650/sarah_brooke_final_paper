As hypothesized, the intensity of a song predicted popularity in a negative direction, while involvement predicted song popularity in a positive direction. As expected, the technicality of a song did not significantly predict song popularity.

The results of the second analysis differed from the hypothesis. While song length was predictive of track type, the relationship was in the opposite direction from expected. We expected to find that longer tracks were less likely to be songs, as we expected that these would more likely be podcast epidosdes. Instead, longer tracks were more likely to be songs. These results could indicate that there are shorter tracks in the Spotify data which are not songs. It is unclear what kind of tracks these would be. Further analysis should investigate the characteristics of short and long tracks.
