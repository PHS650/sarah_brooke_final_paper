From an exploratory factor analysis of several variables in the TidyTuesday Spotify data, three factors emerged that describe various components of the songs [@tabachnickUsingMultivariateStatistics2019]. See @fig-fa3 for a visual description of the factors.

It is hypothesized that both the intensity and involvement factors will predict song popularity such that the higher the factor score, the more likely the the song will have a higher popularity score (over and above the effects of the other factor scores). The third factor, technicality, will not significantly predict song popularity.

**Compact model:** song_popularity = b~0~

**Augemented model:** song_popularity = b~0~ + b~1_intensity~ + b~2_involvement~ + b~3_technicality~ (all predictors are continuous)
