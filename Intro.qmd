# Introduction

We seek to explore various aspects of song data taken from Spotify. The data is available through TidyTuesday, found [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-01-21/readme.md).

The TidyTuesday project aims to help those learning R use the software in real-world applications. We use the available data to answer two major questions. We seek to find predictors of song popularity as well as those for track type (song or otherwise) and whether a track is both live and acoustic.
