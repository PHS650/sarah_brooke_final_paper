I'm going to run an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to find out, and then create factor scores based on the latent dimensions that I find.\n\n#### Correlation matrix\n\nBefore running the EFA, first I'll look at a correlation matrix to see whether any of the variables have reasonable correlations.\n\n```{r}\ncor_matrix <- d %>% \n  select(danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, duration_ms) %>% \n  cor(use = \"pairwise.complete.obs\")\n\ncor_matrix %>% \n  round(2) %>% \n  knitr::kable()\n```\n\nLooking at the correlation matrix, it seems that loudness and energy are highly positively correlated (r = .68), valence and danceability are positively correlated (r = .33), acousticness and energy are negatively correlated (r = -.54), and acousticness and loudness are negatively correlated (r = -.36). There are a few other smaller correlations, but these are the main ones. I wonder if there could be two factors that relate to how upbeat or chill a song is.\n\nIn terms of outliers, it looks like duration in ms, mode, and key aren't really correlated with much, but mode and key are correlated with each other. I think I'm going to eliminate duration in ms because I'm not sure that relates a ton to the other variables. I'll keep mode and key! (Also I'm aware this is pretty arbitrary but I'm just going with it haha)\n\n```{r}\n# removing the outlier (duration_ms) from the correlation matrix\ncor_matrix2 <- d %>% \n  select(danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo) %>% \n  cor(use = \"pairwise.complete.obs\")\n```\n\n\n## Sarah\n\nI created three new variables in this data. Table 1 shows the new variables created from the existing Spotify data which includes song length (in minutes), whether the track is a song, and whether the track is both live and acoustic.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"Chapter3.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"Chapter3.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","documentclass":"scrreprt"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
