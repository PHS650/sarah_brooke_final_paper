It is hypothesized that both the intensity and involvement factors will predict song popularity such that the higher the factor score, the more likely the the song will have a higher popularity score (over and above the effects of the other factor scores). The third factor, technicality, will not significantly predict song popularity.\nsong_popularity = b0 + b1_intensity + b2_involvement + b3_technicality [all predictors are continuous]\n\n\n2.1.2 Hypothesis 2 (Sarah):\nI hypothesize that song length will predict track type (song or not) but will not predict whether a song is both live and acoustic. For the relationship between track length and track type, I expect that longer tracks are less likely to be a song. I hypothesize that covariates (tempo, loudness, genre) would not affect the outcome.\np(song) = b0 + b1_length (+ b2_tempo + b3_loudness + b4_genre) (where genre is categorical, song is binary, and the rest of the variables in the model are continuous)\np(liv_acoust) = b0 + b1_length (+ b2_tempo + b3_loudness + b4_genre) (where genre is categorical, liv_acoust is binary, and the rest of the variables in the model are continuous)"

Factor One seems to describe the intensity of a song and a measurable amount of property, so I’ll rename Factor One to pa1_intensity (pa = principal axis and 1 = originally factor 1). Factor Two seems to describe level of involvement, which may be a little bit of a stretch, but involvement meaning the extent to which singers, instruments, and movement (i.e., dancing) contribute to a song. I’ll rename Factor Two to pa2_involvement. Finally, Factor Three is pretty basic and describe very technical aspects of songs, so I’ll rename Factor Three to pa3_technicality."

There are a few other smaller correlations, but these are the main ones. I wonder if there could be two factors that relate to how upbeat or chill a song is.\nIn terms of outliers, it looks like duration in ms, mode, and key aren’t really correlated with much, but mode and key are correlated with each other. I think I’m going to eliminate duration in ms because I’m not sure that relates a ton to the other variables. I’ll keep mode and key!

Table 4.2 shows the results of the same estimate but with the added covariates genre (as a factor variable), tempo, and loudness.\nThe results of the first model (Table 4.1) indicates that a longer track length is associated with a 2.6936147 higher likelihood of being a song. When we add in the other covariates (Model 2, Table 4.2), the likelihood of a track being a song is 1.6704087 times higher when a track is 1 minute longer.\nThe results of Models 3 and 4 (Table 4.3 and Table 4.4) show us that track length do not determine the combined liveness and acoustiness of a track. The results for both models were not significant.\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.1: Results of logistic regression for the likelihood of a track being a song\n\n\nPredictor\nB\nSE\nt\np\n\n\n\n\nIntercept\n3.789980\n0.7869710\n4.815908\n<0.001\n\n\nSong Length\n0.990884\n0.2493854\n3.973303\n<0.001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.2: Results of logistic regression for the likelihood of a track being a song\n\n\nPredictor\nB\nSE\nt\np\n\n\n\n\nIntercept\n25.0632353\n999.5598439\n0.0250743\n0.980\n\n\nSong Length\n0.5130683\n0.2233860\n2.2967791\n0.022\n\n\nLatin\n-14.7769053\n999.5596611\n-0.0147834\n0.988\n\n\nPop\n-14.8179003\n999.5596497\n-0.0148244\n0.988\n\n\nR&B\n-15.9001386\n999.5593306\n-0.0159071\n0.987\n\n\nRap\n-17.4947084\n999.5591802\n-0.0175024\n0.986\n\n\nRock\n0.1604662\n1473.9345720\n0.0001089\n>0.999\n\n\nTempo\n-0.0203002\n0.0060161\n-3.3743024\n<0.001\n\n\nLoudness\n0.1259179\n0.0454044\n2.7732540\n0.006\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.3: Results of logistic regression for the likelihood of a track being both live and acoustic\n\n\nPredictor\nB\nSE\nt\np\n\n\n\n\nIntercept\n-26.56607\n7672.975\n-0.0034623\n0.997\n\n\nSong Length\n0.00000\n1970.860\n0.0000000\n>0.999\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.4: Results of logistic regression for the likelihood of a track being a song\n\n\nPredictor\nB\nSE\nt\np\n\n\n\n\nIntercept\n-26.56607\n13342.03004\n-0.0019912\n0.998\n\n\nSong Length\n0.00000\n2020.67775\n0.0000000\n>0.999\n\n\nLatin\n0.00000\n6797.83425\n0.0000000\n>0.999\n\n\nPop\n0.00000\n6673.65838\n0.0000000\n>0.999\n\n\nR&B\n0.00000\n6913.60360\n0.0000000\n>0.999\n\n\nRap\n0.00000\n6671.68279\n0.0000000\n>0.999\n\n\nRock\n0.00000\n7026.27785\n0.0000000\n>0.999\n\n\nTempo\n0.00000\n74.04276\n0.0000000\n>0.999\n\n\nLoudness\n0.00000\n690.17222\n0.0000000\n>0.999"

The first model estimates the likelihood that a track is a song with track length as the predictor. The second model estimates the likelihood that a track is both live and acoustic with the same main predictor. Models 3 and 4 mirror models 1 and 2 but include the covariates tempo, loundess, and genre. Results are presented in odds ratios."
