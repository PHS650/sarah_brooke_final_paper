It is hypothesized that both the intensity and involvement factors will predict song popularity such that the higher the factor score, the more likely the the song will have a higher popularity score (over and above the effects of the other factor scores). The third factor, technicality, will not significantly predict song popularity.\nsong_popularity = b0 + b1_intensity + b2_involvement + b3_technicality [all predictors are continuous]\n\n\n2.1.2 Hypothesis 2 (Sarah):\nI hypothesize that song length will predict track type (song or not) but will not predict whether a song is both live and acoustic. For the relationship between track length and track type, I expect that longer tracks are less likely to be a song. I hypothesize that covariates (tempo, loudness, genre) would not affect the outcome.\np(song) = b0 + b1_length (+ b2_tempo + b3_loudness + b4_genre) (where genre is categorical, song is binary, and the rest of the variables in the model are continuous)\np(liv_acoust) = b0 + b1_length (+ b2_tempo + b3_loudness + b4_genre) (where genre is categorical, liv_acoust is binary, and the rest of the variables in the model are continuous)"

Factor One seems to describe the intensity of a song and a measurable amount of property, so I’ll rename Factor One to pa1_intensity (pa = principal axis and 1 = originally factor 1). Factor Two seems to describe level of involvement, which may be a little bit of a stretch, but involvement meaning the extent to which singers, instruments, and movement (i.e., dancing) contribute to a song. I’ll rename Factor Two to pa2_involvement. Finally, Factor Three is pretty basic and describe very technical aspects of songs, so I’ll rename Factor Three to pa3_technicality."

There are a few other smaller correlations, but these are the main ones. I wonder if there could be two factors that relate to how upbeat or chill a song is.\nIn terms of outliers, it looks like duration in ms, mode, and key aren’t really correlated with much, but mode and key are correlated with each other. I think I’m going to eliminate duration in ms because I’m not sure that relates a ton to the other variables. I’ll keep mode and key! (Also I’m aware this is pretty arbitrary but I’m just going with it haha)\n\n# removing the outlier (duration_ms) from the correlation matrix\ncor_matrix2 <- d %>% \n  select(danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo) %>% \n  cor(use = \"pairwise.complete.obs\")"
